# OpenPrint3d--Phantom-edition
This repository is not an official OpenPrint3D project. OpenPrint3D is a community-driven initiative, and I take no credit for the original concept, tools, or ecosystem.

This repo simply contains the profiles, configurations, and tweaks that I have put together based on my own research and testing. My goal is to make it easier for others to get up and running and hopefully provide something genuinely useful to the community.

Disclaimer

I am not an official OpenPrint3D developer.

All original credit goes to the OpenPrint3D team and community.

Use these files at your own discretion and always review settings before running a print.
