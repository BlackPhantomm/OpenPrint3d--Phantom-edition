## ⚠️ Disclaimer & Credits
**This repository is not an official OpenPrint3D project.**

OpenPrint3D is a community-driven initiative, and I take no credit for the original concept, tools, or ecosystem. All original credit goes to the incredible OpenPrint3D team and community.

**I give credit where it is due:** [https://github.com/OpenPrint3D/OpenPrint3D](https://github.com/OpenPrint3D/OpenPrint3D)

This repo simply contains the profiles, configurations, and tweaks that I have put together based on my own research and testing. My goal is to make it easier for others to get up and running and hopefully provide something genuinely useful to the community.
